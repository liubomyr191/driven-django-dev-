Introduction

Why Test-Driven Development?
----------------------------

When starting out an application, at first you may not need tests.  Tests can be difficult to write at first and they take time, but they can save an enormous amount of manual troubleshooting time.

As your application grows it becomes more difficult to grow and to refactor your code.  There's always the risk that a change in one part of your application will break another part.
