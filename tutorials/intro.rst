Why Test-Driven Development?
----------------------------

When starting out an application, at first you may not need tests.  Tests can
be difficult to write at first and they take time, but they can save an
enormous amount of manual troubleshooting time.

As your application grows it becomes more difficult to grow and to refactor
your code.  There's always the risk that a change in one part of your
application will break another part.


Prerequisites
-------------

* The `Django Tutorial <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/intro/tutorial01/>`_

The Project: building a blog
----------------------------

The right of passage for most web developers is their own blog system. There
are hundreds of solutions out there.  The features and requirements are
generally well understood. Writing one with TDD becomes a kind of `code kata
<http://codekata.pragprog.com/>`_ that can help you work through all kinds of
aspects of the Django framework.
